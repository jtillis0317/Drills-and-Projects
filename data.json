Sometimes it\u2019s tricky to spot sexism because it could just be a problem with an individual and have nothing to do with gender. Still, my story makes me feel discriminated based on the qualities I may possess because I\u2019ve been conditioned to cultivate them as a woman. I\u2019m not a housewife: I go to work part-time and I\u2019m a university student. I\u2019m currently off work to care for our newborn baby, but I still have one class at uni and coursework to do. In a nutshell: I manage our household. If I didn\u2019t dole out the tasks to make things more equal, I\u2019d be doing everything on my own. I\u2019ve spent so much time over the years discussing or arguing about cooking and cleaning, the things that take up so much time in our daily lives. My partner agrees that we need to share the responsibilities at home but doesn\u2019t believe in doing things regularly. He would clean the toilet twice a year and eat a warm meal every day from a cheap snack-bar down the street from us in order to save himself the trouble of doing chores and doesn\u2019t expect me to do the cooking or the cleaning either, so that\u2019s why he\u2019s not discriminating against me based on my gender. But the fact that I do clean the apartment on a regular basis and keep our kitchen stocked with healthy meals means that at the end of the day, I\u2019m running the household on my own. It\u2019s convenient that my partner doesn\u2019t have to feel like a sexist when he eats his dinner at the table I\u2019ve wiped his breakfast crumbs from by telling me that I don\u2019t have to do anything at home if I don\u2019t want to. Because he does see that he needs to share the workload with me, he will clean or prepare a meal (from time to time) but I always have to tell him what to do. In this respect I\u2019m the house manager, organising our home-life on my own and enlisting my partner\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d rather than working with him on an equal level. I know that not all men are like this, and that in some cases, the man is the cook and keeps the home clean. Having spoken with others about their partnerships though, I get the feeling a lot of women are doing more than their fair share at home while working outside of the home. Not all men are abusers either, but I\u2019m bringing this up because I think that many partnerships between men and women are tainted by long-standing conditioning of gender roles and that we\u2019ve lost sight of the source of this problem in 2018 where we believe we\u2019re on an equal level and that we\u2019re free to do what we please.

They started pacing the perimeter of the fence, and we got a sense that there were more than 2, although it was hard to count how many, because there were lots of bushes. They were back at the gate, and I was feeling increasingly frightened. The gate was climbable; we were basically sitting ducks for these abusive, threatening, misogynistic and persistent men. So I phoned 999. The men could hear  me, so I didn\u2019t explain how easy it would be for them to get at us, but I reported their language, their threats, and the fact that we couldn\u2019t get away without the police. The operator sounded quite shocked at the extent of their abuse, and said she\u2019d get someone out. She didn\u2019t offer to keep me on the line, although I didn\u2019t realise how remiss that was until later. We waited for the police. We put out our fire (which had been a source of security and comfort as well as heat) because we didn\u2019t want to keep the police waiting. We waited. For 20 minutes. For longer. The men went quiet and disappeared. We didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d gone, but eventually decided to peep out of the gate to see, because god knows when (if?) the police would show.
