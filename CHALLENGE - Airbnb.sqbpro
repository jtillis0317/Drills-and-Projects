---When determining the most popular city, it depends on your definition of &quot;popular.&quot; 
--One definition would be that that neighborhood has the most listings. In that case, the most popular neighborhoods are Five Points, Highland, and Capitol Hill.
--A second definition of &quot;popular&quot; would be that people book (and leave reviews) there most often. In that case, the most popular neighborhoods are Highland, Cheesman Park, and North Park Hill.
