I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.\", reviewTime='06 25, 2012', reviewerID='A5A4374R8I7NB', reviewerName='PWB Esq', summary='Works Fine, But It Died On ME', unixReviewTime=1340582400, amazing=0, great=0, awful=0, perfect=0, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=1, only=1, poor=0, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=1, defective=0, stopped=0, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {8: 1.0, 9: 1.0, 13: 1.0})),\n",

I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it.

I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.

It doesn\\'t have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to \"press 1 for English\", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.

       " Row(asin='B0006FLA80', reviewText='I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm\\'s responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a \"free return and repair,\" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don\\'t work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don\\'t understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they\\'re doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn\\'t that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon\\'s remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can\\'t figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don\\'t get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?

If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.

There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling.

I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.

I almost deserted them to get the phone, but in mid-June, I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts, all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards, it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However, it is not all great news. First, I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and, worse, deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with, but losing contacts, which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo.

However, we\\'ve both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don\\'t work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I\\'ve had the same problems when it\\'s less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we\\'ll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can\\'t hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It\\'s a series of \"hello-hello? HELLO?\" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can\\'t hear what the other party is saying. It\\'s very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I\\'ve never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it\\'s flashing. But it\\'s always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn\\'t take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can\\'t be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I\\'ve gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can\\'t take this headset back, I\\'m purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it\\'s design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone.

It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain \\'tronics store.)On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way.

       " Row(asin='B000BBCTJ8', reviewText='I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let\\'s consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn\\'t take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn\\'t have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics\\' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar \"Please say a command\" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting \"Please say a command\".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn\\'t for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts \"Comfort\" and \"Ease of Use\".  As you can see from my results, it doesn\\'t deliver on either of these.  It\\'s a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.

In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I\\'ve seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn\\'t have a manufacturer\\'s tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone\\'s camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no \"favorites/shortcuts\"- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don\\'t believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn\\'t well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the \"File\" menu on all Windows programs, it\\'s the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn\\'t figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don\\'t believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync\\'s with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I\\'ve had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn\\'t apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.', reviewTime='07 22, 2006', reviewerID='AF5MYIR1E75L8', reviewerName='jb in sd', summary='pretty, yes, but to me .... a waste of money', unixReviewTime=1153526400, amazing=0, great=1, awful=0, perfect=0, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=0, only=1, poor=1, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=0, defective=0, stopped=1, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {1: 1.0, 9: 1.0, 10: 1.0, 15: 1.0})),\n",

About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.

It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 \"Cobalt\").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA\\'s reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA\\'s antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.

Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology.

Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model, but it is not any different in design.  However, it's so cheap with rebate, it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore, after this appealing review, and you still want to buy this thing, I would go for the newer one.

       " Row(asin='B000GX9D9K', reviewText=\"Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.\", reviewTime='07 13, 2008', reviewerID='ASHMKDJI9Q3K4', reviewerName='K.

If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece.

I decided I didn\\'t want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don\\'t overlap a great deal.  In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just \"different\" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that, I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However, I\\'m not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn\\'t like that.Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.', reviewTime='04 1, 2010', reviewerID='A12R93JEX6C435', reviewerName='M.

This latter item item didn\\'t score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can\\'t always trust the ratings.In the case of this \"Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,\" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a \"Cellet\" universal mount in the title, but in the description it\\'s referred to as a \"Luxmo\" universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it\\'s not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient \"vent.\"  Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or \"Vent Mount (non)solution.\"  So it was on to Plan B, the \"Dash Mount\" solution (at least it\\'s a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here\\'s where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this \"adjustable\" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo\\'s right arm, nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one.  Unfortunately, my gentle tugging  pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) \"Adjustable Grip.\"Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I\\'d given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff.  But even more fortunately, I can now put this review to rest.  May the next buyer have a happier story to tell.

This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with.  Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop.

Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made. It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.Further, once you set it up, you can only use it on one ear. Other headsets (like Plantronics ones for example) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear. The Jawbone doesn't do this.While the Jawbone's noise cancellation does seem good that's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled, soft and digital-like. Further, the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible. They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer. But, my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it, they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website. If I bought from some other retailer, it has ZERO warranty!

It's easy to hook up but you'll need an adapter if your headunit doesn't have free RCA inputs. There's no provision for bridging or adding to an existing RCA input device. The cord provided seems to be long enough but when you actually get to threading it around the dash bits of your car it's not long enough to reach up into the roof lining or sun visors where the mic could adequately pick up your voice. The mic is horrible- the noise suppression basically doesn't work and you'll sound like you're in a tin can regardless of how loud you turn this up. Fortunately, on the output side the unit works well and includes a switch which lets you route signal to your left or right car speakers. It doesn't seem to have a provision to route it to both so you're likely to have to turn up your stereo quite loud to hear the other person.The controls don't work for my android phone or my wifes nor with my daughter's nokia so don't think you'll be able to answer or hang up with the interface on the mic unit. It also doesn't seem to control any digital music players we've tried. The unit only works for one bluetooth device at a time so if it's hooked up to a passenger's phone or computer you won't be able to use it for your phone. Also, it has to be paired whenever you switch bluetooth devices; it doesn't seem to remember units it's paired with previously.The head unit has an incredibly bright blue led that's so obnoxious I've had to face the unit against the headliner to prevent it from being distracting at night. The led will literally light up the inside of your car; it's that bright and blinking. You can't turn it off or change the color- it just blinks and annoys.So, for this rather amazingly high price you get a unit which doesn't work very well at it's basic tasks (picking up speech, playing music or letting you listen to callers) and doesn't have any special features- like multiple pairing, memory or a connection which allows you to have other auxillary devices on your headunit.

While it looks great and does have a slide out keyboard, this phone has serious issues. I agree with many here, it is slow as Hell. If you needed help or have an emergency, your are out of luck. It takes forever to boot up. Of course, leaving it on drains the battery big time. I had my phone synced to my computer and bought a few apps for it and this slowed it down even further. It got so bad, I had to completely reset the device, wiping out all my info. I stopped syncing it and had to ditch some apps I really liked because the Tilt had issues with them. The Internet looks horrible on this phone, it is slow even with a 3G connection and I don't bother with the Wi-Fi. I won't play music on it. Call quality is also not great. I use a Jabra bluetooth which makes calls sound much better and clearer than the phone itself. The lag time for opening anything is far too long. It takes what seems like an eternity for the Windows Mobile system to open apps up. I had used Motorolas, (hated those), Nokia (loved them) and this was the first HTC phone I have tried. It will be my last. I have an iPod Touch which I love and now want an iPhone. The Touch is easier to use than this. The Tilt is too overpiced for how it (does not) perform.

The Tilt will allow you to directly access features by both screen touch and stylus. Connections to the Internet may be slow, but it will use the best option available without bugging you. The Internet does not look as good as it does on an iPod Touch or an iPhone. The buttons on the face do light up and are easy to see quickly and the keyboard is helpful. Navigation is better than I orginally thought.  It is not enough to change my rating or suggest purchasing it unless you really want a PDA more than a phone.

In particular, my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility, usability, and quality. So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset, the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a, even though the Jabra site claims, \"It Will Work :) \". The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone, so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive. I tried my phone with other headsets (OEM wired one, Aliph Jawbone, Moto H700) which all worked fully and flawlessly, so the phone is not at fault. I went through severl procedures with Jabra, who ultimately replaced the headset, all without success. Also, my older phones (an S710a and T637) woked perfectly well. So there\\'s clearly a compatibility issue, once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second, the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10. On the JX-10, all \"headset\" functions (initiate call via voice dialing, answer call, end call) required a single short button press, and \"handsfree\" functions (reject incoming call, redial last call, call waiting switch, etc.) needed only a single long button press. That couldn\\'t be easier. The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse, such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions. Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability, and lost it.Finally, the BT8040\\'s \"eargel version 2\" does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in, or falling out of, your ear. The separately sold Jabra Eargels v.1 (which I used with my JX-10) are more stable and more comfortable. Sadly, these v.1 eargels do not fit this headset.With the BT8040, Jabra\\'s maintained their other attributes - functionality, call quality and volume, build quality, small size and light weight - hence I give it 2 stars instead of one. But the incompatibility is unacceptable, especially with Sony Ericsson phones (the kings of Bluetooth).

Callers sometimes complained of an echo tooThe unfortunate truth is that I received so many complaints that I had to get rid of the head set after only 4 months. What a waste of money!(Incidentally, I replaced this headset with the Plantronics Voyager 510.  After 1 month of usage, I like it alot!  Callers can hear me clearly and I can hear them well.

Considering the special features designed for sound quality I was expecting the best sound ever, but oh well. The way I compared headsets was to pair two at a time, put one in each ear, and then switch between them while on the same call. This allowed me and the caller to compare sound quality equally while in a variety of environments, and from both ends of the call. I tested these headsets: Jabra BT8040, Jabra BT500, Plantronics Voyager 510, Plantronics Explorer 320, Motorola HS850, Motorola H700, Jawbone, Samsung WEP200. The problem was that the sound quality for the caller was so bad that they could hardly understand a word I said. If I held the unit a few inches in front of my mouth they could hear me clearly but not when it was in my ear. With all the other units I tested I go through a series of background noise tests with both the caller and myself talking and listening, but in this case we weren't able to comunicate well enough to get that done. After testing the other units we went back and tried this one some more but nothing seemed to make a difference. This is a beautifull headset. It looks great, feels great, with great function and fit, but if they can't understand what I'm saying then there's no point. Man, I'm bummed!

I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord.  None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured. My reason for needing this is not the iPhone. It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.Without any regular use or ware and tear, each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones. I am not an audiophile, the headphones are inexpensive, and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here\\'s my report of each adapter:White adapter received from seller \"CRONUZ\" - 1 star:The cord feels flimsy. The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery. From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material, I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it doesn\\'t break before that.White adapter received from seller \"eTECH\" (mailing label said \"iflash Inc\") - 1 star:The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ. The only additional concern with this adapter is that I can\\'t get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force.  I did force them in to test the sound quality, but I don\\'t plan on using this cord again. Also, because the 2 white adapters look identical, I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.Black adapterreceived from seller \"Eforcity\" (not this listing) - 3 stars:This adapter also has a flimsy cord. The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested.  The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones. I believe I can get some use out of this one, but wouldn\\'t buy another one.Black adapterreceived from seller \"Elago Design\" (not this listing) - 5 stars:First of all, the 5 stars is based on this being less than $2. I wouldn\\'t say this is the best adapter you can buy. This is however the best one I tested. The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others.  The female plug has a tighter fit and no play. The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest. This cord doesn\\'t meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head, but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.If you order this or any other item and don\\'t receive what was pictured and listed, contact the seller.

I use it very little for music but extensively for watching movies, shows, etc. The stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know, besides medicore sound quality they are just so uncomfortable so I was on the look out for something more comfortable for myself and something with great sound for my husband who uses his ipod touch every day on his 1 1/2 hour commute to/from NYC.What we ended up with was a pair of these and a pair of the vmoda\\'sV-MODA Vibe Earbuds - Gunmetal Blackwhich retail for about $100 less.I had already decided these would be mine, as I said he\\'s the audiophile but strangely doesn\\'t mind the stock earbuds and didn\\'t care what he ended up with. I was so excited when they arrived, I had already tried out the vmoda\\'s and really really liked them and assumed with the $100 price difference these would be that much better.Love ended quickly, I thought it was to difficult to put them in my ears (pull your ear up and out with one hand, twist in with the other) sure it blocked out the outside sound but in a \"head underwater in the bathtub\" manner, the sound wasn\\'t clear and true but muffled to me, and no bass... just none. I tried all the different size fittings, tried putting them in different ways (yes I tried a very deep tight fitting, still awful), tried different songs. I was in disbelief so I grabbed hubby and made him try them vs the vmodas, he agreed instantly that the vmodas were infinitely better. I did find if I gently (not pushing so much as just barely touching) held my finger tips to them when they were in that the sound was much better, but I\\'m not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears. Maybe I got a bad pair, maybe my ears just work better with the vmoda... whatever the reason I wasn\\'t impressed with these and feel that the $100 you\\'d save by getting the vmoda\\'s could be applied to a new ipod or lots more music from itunes.I didn\\'t have the chance to try them out as a phone as I don\\'t have an iphone, and I\\'m not sure if the double click to advance songs only works on an iphone, it didn\\'t work on my ipod touch (would have been a very nice feature if it did).The case these come with is nice though, for what that\\'s worth.', reviewTime='07 4, 2008', reviewerID='A3R7RE5O61M112', reviewerName='@homemom', summary='I want to love them, I really do... but I hate them!', unixReviewTime=1215129600, amazing=0, great=1, awful=1, perfect=0, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=0, only=1, poor=0, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=0, defective=0, stopped=0, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {1: 1.0, 2: 1.0, 9: 1.0})),\n",

The HF2 still doesn't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear, but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good: Sadly at least on my BlackBerry, the microphone is terrible.  It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation.  The people I call tell me that I'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I'm in a quiet location.  Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside.  The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth.  I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it isn't twisted to point away.Then the terrible: I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone.

It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2...At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever.BOTTOM  LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund.  I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied.

And, indeed, the screen protector is perfectly shaped to fit on the screen from just above the roller ball, all the way up to the silver speaker above the \"BlackBerry\" logo.But here\\'s the thing: This product has shown me that my Blackberry screen is not perfectly flat. Run your fingers over your 8310 and if you have the same model as me, you\\'ll see what I mean - the black area with the \"BlackBerry\" logo is gently rounded into a \"bump\" shape.So it really doesn\\'t matter that the protector went on cleanly for me, or that the second pull tab worked fine and didn\\'t leave a sticky residue, or that the shape of the protector is perfect. It doesn\\'t matter because no matter how careful you are to push all the air bubbles out, they will creep steadily back in in the niche between the \"BlackBerry\" bump and the actual screen. And this lateral air bubble ends up taking up a fair whack of screen real estate, unless you press it out every single time you want to use your phone.*However*, all that said: This package came with three screen protectors, so after going through the first two with the same results, I trimmed the third one so that it cuts offs instantly before the \"BlackBerry\" bump. And now the screen protector works perfectly - flat, no air bubbles, no sticky mess, and good protection from scratches, fingerprints, and the mild rough handling it receives in my purse.So I guess I recommend these for the price... if you\\'re willing to modify them yourself... and if you can cut a clean, straight line.

I think it is unfortunate that certain people consider using bluetooth to be uncool and somehow associated with a rather hateful stereotypical image of a Hummer-driving yuppie. If you're driving and talking, GET a Bluetooth headset! I would rather see people driving around on the road like they are telephone tech supports than blind and distracted zombies. That ends my rant on why I believe everyone should be using a wireless headset. Now let's talk about this Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth.I've gone through a few Bluetooth headsets in the past few years - mostly Motorola and Jarba models priced around 20 bucks. I had absolutely no complaints regarding these economy models. When I received this 150 dollars headset(!) in the mail, I was seriously expecting to be awed and shocked with a level of performance, feature, and luxury I had previous unexperienced.The unboxing and setup process was pretty straight forward. One fancy feature that is indeed very useful is that a leather carrying pouch was included, and it isn't just any plain leather pouch either. The carrying pouch, in fact, has a built-in battery. When the headset is stored inside the pouch, you can plug in the charging cable and charge both the headset and the charging pouch. So later on, when you're on the road, you in fact have two batteries ready to be used which greatly extends the hours of use between charging. Unfortunately, the charging carrying case is the only positive thing I can say about this headset.According to the manual and the packaging, the headset supposed to have some fancy audio-processing logic which will make the phone conversation crystal clear. Alas, it was not the case. Once I got the headset bonded with my Verizon KRZR phone and made a test call to my wife, the voice sounded rather dull, down-sampled, and somewhat metallic. This is unacceptable for a 150 BT headset! I can honestly say, in term of voice clarity, all my previous 20-buck Motorola/Jarba outperformed this ridiculously overpriced headset by far. I have not tried the headset with any other cell phones. But a Motorola KRZR is a rather common handset, and Plantronics 925 gave me quite a let-down.In conclusion, I will not recommend this headset to anyone at its current price. If it was around $30 - $40 (currently Amazon is already offering at 50% off the original listing price), and only if looks/design is more important to you than voice clarity, perhaps only then I will recommend it to you.Sorry Plantronics, I honestly, genuinely wanted to love this headset.

The unit was pretty comfortable for me, but did not fit her well because my wife's ear canal is shallow and the ear pads of the unit are designed for a deeper ear canal.  She prefers one that hooks securely around the ear.  Anyway, when I plugged it in to charge it for the first time, I noticed that the charger power light lit up green as soon as I plugged it in, but the light went out as soon as I plugged the charger into the unit or the case for the unit.  Since the directions indicate that all lights turn off when the unit was fully charged, I assumed that was the case.  However, after pairing it with the phone, I immediately heard it signalling that the battery was almost dead.

I have silently cursed at those whose self-importance required they stare off into space while conversing with some unseen counterpart. Another problem I felt was with the gigantic bug perched on the speaker's ear--it looked simply awful.The Plantronics Discovery 925 headset promised to buck the trend, not of speaking with the non-present but of drastically trimming and streamlining the size of that bug on the ear. As I needed a way to speak on my cell phone without encumbering my hand, I believed I needed to accept the inevitable and get one.First, I was surprised by how truly small the Discovery is! No longer does it feel like a crawling cockroach has gone to sleep on the ear but the tasteful design is, as the product brochure says, fashion-forward. It is light and sleek and even better, no flashing blue light broadcasting like a lighthouse either.Second and more surprising was how easy it was to setup. The adequate manual instructed that my cell phone needed to be in discovery mode and also what to do to achieve a pairing between the headset and the phone. I achieved this step rather quickly and easily.It was a bit difficult to know what steps to take next as I needed to focus on how to get it working after the initial pairing. I quickly discovered that through a confusing series of beeps, lengthy button pushes (the 925 has just one), and blinking lights of different colors, the headset is able to make and receive calls. A more careful reading of the manual showed me the error of my usual way of jumping into using electronics: after that, it was easy to know what beep meant what and what one or more colored blinks signified. Lesson: read the manual.The Plantronics came encased in a very nice carrying case which doubles as a recharging station. In other words, the case houses a battery which charges the headset if cradled. It also came with two ways of charging: a direct connection to a power outlet or a USB cable for computer recharging. Very convenient.The clarity is superb and I've never had a problem understanding any phone calls. The headset is lodged into the ear lobe with the help of a soft Silicone (at least I think its Silicone) wedge which I thought would be uncomfortable at best. It wasn't and turned out to be actually pleasant.I can find absolutely nothing wrong with the Plantronics Discovery. For approximately $120, I would hope not anyway, but I find its ease-of-use and setup to be so enjoyable that I heartily recommend it. I did wish the manual were a tad larger and easier to read, and the user has to be really careful as I can see how easy it would be to break the headset but that's a small quibble for a phenomenal product.

Yes, it looks sleek and neat - and I was very happy with my prior Plantronics Voyager 510 headset, BUT -It is one of the most uncomfortable earpieces I\\'ve ever had. I was just on a call of 28 minutes and my ear hurts. I cannot put the unit back on my ear now because of the pain it causes. I\\'ve tried adjusting the gel, tried different gels, but can\\'t find any combination that doesn\\'t hurt my ear after being on for a moderate period of time.The instructions that come with the unit are sparse and inadequate.And the unit itself is \"fragile\" - mine will already need to be exchanged/warranty returned: now, when I put any pressure on it (pushing it in my ear, or pushing the control button, or even touching it) it starts making a horrible static-y, tone-y loud background noise. Sometimes the noise stops when the finger is moved away - other times it stays and I have to switch to using the handset because it\\'s impossible to hear the caller with the added interference.There are a couple of good points for this product, though:1) The sound going into the mic is fed back to the earpiece - So, for example, if it\\'s windy you\\'ll know whether you\\'re sending wind noise to the caller. When I\\'m riding my bike, I find that I can turn my head slightly and eliminate/substantially reduce wind noise. With a headset that doesn\\'t feedback your audio, you have no idea of the noise you are sending.2) The leather carrycase/charger is nice esp since I wouldn\\'t wear any bluetooth all the time. It protects the unit and makes it easy to put in a pocket. HOWEVER - it is NOT easy to seat into the charging plug, and I think that the case being a charger may reduce the life of the internal battery of the earpiece when it is frequently moved in and out of the case (and consequently frequently partially charged/discharged).The discomfort and poor performance/durability makes me regret the purchase.', reviewTime='12 20, 2008', reviewerID='A1M6GJJAGVE4Y5', reviewerName='RG', summary='Uncomfortable & fragile', unixReviewTime=1229731200, amazing=0, great=0, awful=0, perfect=0, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=0, only=0, poor=1, refund=0, disappointed=1, died=0, defective=0, stopped=0, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {10: 1.0, 12: 1.0})),\n",

       " Row(asin='B001630QZE', reviewText='Let me start by saying I LOVE Plantronics products.  Years ago when I used to sell electronics I would always push their products (I did not receive a commission) because they were far superior in sound quality than any other brand out there.  I am the type of person who will spend extra money on something that works well as opposed to something cheap that is not up to the same level of quality.  Here is my review of each aspect of the product:Size/Weight: First, this product is very very light weight. When I first took the headset out of the package and held it I thought it was \"cheap\" feeling because it was so light but after thinking about it for a moment I realized I would much rather have it feel light and cheap than heavy and weighing down my ear.  Overall I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset.Comfort:  The weight of the product and the gel-ish inserts made the product fit comfortably in my ear.  I wore the product for lengthy periods and never felt any significant level of discomfort.  Overall I am impressed by the aspect of this headset.Style: First, I do not rock a fanny pack for a reason and in my opinion most Bluetooth headsets remind me of fanny packs and black socks with sandals.  They are a fashion \"oh heck no.\" However, this particular headset is a nice inconspicuous size.  The gap between the two bars that make up the mouthpiece make the headset look better and less bulky.  Additionally, the mouthpiece is fairly short and does not overtake your face as you talk.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset as I do not want to look like something out of a SciFi movie when chatting on the phone.Syncing with my Bluetooth device:  I have never synced any Bluetooth device to my current cell phone.  The process took under 30 seconds before they were paired together.  The instructions were crystal clear and I did not need my phone\\'s manual to figure anything out.  This aspect of the headset worked amazing.And here\\'s where it all went wrong...Sound Quality (Outgoing):  Let me start by saying, yes, I did have the mouthpiece directed in the way indicated by the Plantronics manual.  Also, my phone was sitting right next to me so this was not a matter of being too far away from my cell phone.  I spoke to dozens of people on the headset over the course of five days, all of whom asked, \"What was that?  Could you repeat that?  Huh?  etc.\"  Most of the time I would have to disconnect the headset and go \"old-fashioned\" by actually using my hands.  When I needed to put the air conditioning on, it was impossible for the other party to hear me due to the wind noise so I had to shut my vents so I could be (somewhat)heard.  Even when there was no background noise of any sort (music, airconditioning, passenger noise), the product failed in this area.  Every person I spoke to complained.  Overall, I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.Sound Quality (Incoming): Everyone I spoke to sounded distant, unclear, and not loud enough to hear well (yes, ALL volumes were at the maximum level).  Often I would try to shove the headset deeper in my ear hoping it would help, however, this would cause me to accidentally hit the \"call end\" button and hang up on the person I was speaking to.  After two times of doing that I learned my lesson and just strained to hear the best I could.  Overall, I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.One star is the minimum Amazon lets a user rate a product.  I gave the rating one extra star because, had the outgoing/incoming quality been excellent, there would be no better Bluetooth product on the market right now because of size, weight, comfort, style, and ease of syncing.', reviewTime='05 23, 2008', reviewerID='A1QTHVA826XEOS', reviewerName='Super Mum', summary='Very Poor Sound Quality', unixReviewTime=1211500800, amazing=1, great=0, awful=0, perfect=0, worst=0, best=1, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=1, only=0, poor=0, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=0, defective=0, stopped=0, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {0: 1.0, 6: 1.0, 8: 1.0})),\n",

I can easily hear the people around me talking and make out their conversations, even when the earphones make a very good seal in my ears.To anyone who has troubles getting a good seal: you can follow the usual steps below for putting earplugs in.1. Hold the earplug in your right hand.2. With your left hand, reach over or behind your head and grip the top of your right ear, pulling upward while you open your jaw slightly.3. Put the earphone in, then let go of your ear.4. Swap sides and put in the left earplug.You might look a little silly when doing it, but it will give you a much tighter seal.  Once you get the idea down, you will be able to do it all with one hand (e.g., use a couple fingers in your right hand to pull up on your right ear while lowering your jaw and using your index finger and thumb to push the right earphone into your ear).These would be okay for twenty-five bucks or less, but not seventy.Update: after 3 years of occasional light use (avg less than once a month), the right earbud stopped working. I never did get them to stay in 100% reliably, even  by inserting them earplug-style. I usually had to stop 3 or 4 times to re-insert them when mowing the lawn.\", reviewTime='07 17, 2008', reviewerID='ARUDTZ5BNUHA6', reviewerName='igen \"igen\"', summary='Not that good for noise isolation, poor bass', unixReviewTime=1216252800, amazing=0, great=0, awful=0, perfect=0, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=0, only=0, poor=0, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=0, defective=0, stopped=1, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {15: 1.0})),\n",

       " Row(asin='B00174N3R0', reviewText=\"After I ordered the Pogo stylus, I learned from several Youtube videos that you can build these yourself for pennies.  So while the Pogo was on its way to me, I did just that.  The review of the Pogo follows, but I need to mention the do-it-yourself version first.  Being an Engineer, I happened to have a bunch of the carbon foam that micro-chips are shipped in, which is the exact same material the Pogo uses.If you hold the foam and brush it against your iPhone, iPad, etc, it works beautifully.  So I tried shaping a piece of the foam into a ball and attached it to the end of a plastic pen.  It didn't work.  No movement at all from the cursor.  You see, the foam completes an electrical circuit between your body and the touchscreen, which is why the barrel of the Pogo is metal.On Youtube, I saw various methods for creating a metal barrrel.  The most intresting is to use a segment of a telescoping antenna.  The only thing I had lying around was an X-acto knife, so I unscrewed and removed the blade from the barrel, and stuffed the foam inside the barrel hole.  Viola!  It stays in place perfectly, and I was able to shape the foam tip into a rounded ball.Now, the reason I mention all of this is NOT to share my arts and crafts skill.  When I got my Pogo, I noticed that I had to push it really hard against the screen to get a consistent response.  If you lightly brush it, it will NOT respond well.  Others have said the same thing.However, my homemade version with the X-acto barrel works like a champ.  Very light touches work consistently.  I wonder if the brushed finish of the Pogo has any coating that is acting as an insulator.  The X-acto barrel is pure, cold metal, and I imagine it is a much better conductor.So, even not comparing the Pogo to my home-made version, I find the Pogo to be not worth the money.  it requires too hard of a contact for my comfort.  I know that eventually the foam tip will lose its spring-feel and I would be scraping the metal of the Pogo barrel against my iPhone.The idea behind the product is great.  Hopefully, Pogo will come out with a version that has a better conducting barrel.  Until then, I highly recommend going to Radio Shack, and buying the cheapest IC they have - just for the packing material.  Make your own stylus, and I bet yours will work better than the Pogo, too.\", reviewTime='06 24, 2010', reviewerID='AKKXYLLFVCHGW', reviewerName='Brian Fuchs', summary='Honestly, not as good as one I built myself', unixReviewTime=1277337600, amazing=0, great=1, awful=0, perfect=1, worst=0, best=0, awesome=0, waste=0, cheap=1, only=1, poor=0, refund=0, disappointed=0, died=0, defective=0, stopped=0, sentiment=0, features=SparseVector(16, {1: 1.0, 3: 1.0, 8: 1.0, 9: 1.0})),\n",

If you are looking for decent noise cancellation, I've found the Samsung WEP470 does just as good of a job, has a dedicated on/off button, and is less than half the price of this headset.

Clarifying statement in terms of the poorly made:  I have send back two units because one unit would not turn off (I tried every trick in the book, but the button was stuck or something else was going on)  The other unit wouldn\\'t turn on consistently.  There would be days where it would work properly and then other days when the darn thing wouldn\\'t powerup (yes, the headphones were fully fully charged).3.  Thus, unless you specifically require this type / shape of headphones (which I do), then I would strongly recommend going with the higher priced but definitely much better Sennheiser wireless phones (ex: the BT line, which are truely 5 star products).4.  On a side note: Kudos to Sennheiser for being a 5 star company;  no questions asked, no hassles, they\\'re a company that stands behind their products and puts out excellent stuff... most of the time.', reviewTime='01 6, 2012', reviewerID='APBB297H3ZA5E', reviewerName='Harry M.

I had a cheap Motorola H375 BT earpiece that worked just fine except it wasn\\'t very comfortable in my ear and fell out easily. It sounded good though.I used to own a Blue Ant Speakerphone. It was great! It had a great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the day it \"buzzed\" and just died. I got a lot of usage from it and I was left with a favorable opinion of the company even though it just went kaboom one day.I am a self professed gadget freak. Ok, there I said it.When I saw the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset and read about it\\'s features I just knew it was for me. Initially it was to expensive but when I saw it on Amazon for $79 I figured I couldn\\'t go wrong.ROFL!Okay, I always try and give new gadgets a fair trial before recommending it to my friends or clients or giving up on it. I have now been using the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset exclusively since December 2009.It is simply the most frustrating Bluetooth earpiece I have ever used! After 3 weeks I turned off the voice prompts & speech recognition. It announces the CallerID for incoming calls but it\\'s seems to take forever to finish what it wants to say BEFORE you can answer the phone.If the earbud isn\\'t perfectly aligned with you ear you will just tick off people if you call or answer them as they can\\'t hear anything you are saying. This is especially prevalent in the car. (2003 Ford Expedition EB, a somewhat quite car)It really has trouble coordinating things with the iPhone 3G. Calling out, no problem, It uses the earpiece just fine. Go to answer a call... Not so much, it selects the iPhone and you manually have to select the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset on the iPhone menu. Okay before I get a bunch of replies, YES I DID TRY \"THIS AND THAT\". It just didn\\'t work properly consistent if at all on the inbound calls.Okay, with all of this, I still continued to try the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset but I have now given up on it.Perhaps I will just put it on my bookshelf and marvel at the technology that allows all this functionality in such a small form factor. I guess I\\'d be more amazed if it actually worked.Pros:Comfortable and stays put on my ear.Volume level is decentGooG-411 built in and is hard coded into the speech recognitionCons:It sucks.Poor audio fidelityNot iPhone friendlyIt sucks.Battery life not to good.Really Bright blinking while on. (This can be deactivated but likes to come back on)It sucks.In case I wasn\\'t clear, I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.I hope you find this review useful as I too read these reviews myself when I am about to purchase products, like the new Bluetooth headset I am going to buy now.

       " Row(asin='B001APH9GW', reviewText=\"The idea of this Bluetooth headset is a good one however I had some problems with the voice commands capability. On more than one occasion in a months time, it stopped recognizing any voice commends (like 'dial voicemail' 'call back' etc). I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again.I also thought the caller id announce would be nice, but in practice, it only works if you wear the headset all the time. If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce, but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call, it only works about half of the time. I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this. Also, I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off. For this, I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage. With the BlueAnt, I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use.Also, on the BlueAnt, callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise. In practice, noise cancellation isn't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway. If I'm in my car, I just roll the windows up, no big deal.I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue. The fact that my voice didn't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me. I'd rather sound better and not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy.\", reviewTime='09 13, 2008', reviewerID='A1F9Z42CFF9IAY', reviewerName='T.
