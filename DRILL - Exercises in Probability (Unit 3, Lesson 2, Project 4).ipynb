Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",

    "Answer: The conclusion is wrong because there is sample bias involved. Those who are offered the survey are not representative of the population because they are the only ones CLICKING on links. This leaves out an entire (likely large) subset of the population that may click on no links whatsoever...spending very little time on the company website."
